This application is a UI replication of the [Headspace app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-sleep-meditation/id493145008?platform=iphone). Most visible content and all of the layout/design is directly copied from the Headspace app, so credit goes to those lovely folks. Please be mindful of this. This repo is public as a means for sharing my learning progress and skill growth over time.

# Overview
I started this project as a means to practice my Swift UI skills without the need to come up with a novel app and my own design ideas. I found this approach to be a great way to foce me to try new things and figure out how to do things I might have otherwise avoided.
