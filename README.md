# Disclaimer
This application is a UI replication of the [Headspace app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/headspace-sleep-meditation/id493145008?platform=iphone). Most visible content and all of the layout/design is directly copied from the Headspace app, so credit goes to those lovely folks. Please be mindful of this. This repo is public as a means for sharing my learning progress and skill development.

# Overview
I started this project as a means to practice my Swift UI skills without the need to come up with a novel app and my own design ideas. I found this approach forced me to figure out how to properly implement designs I might have otherwise avoided. As you might imagin, the app is large and while I did manage to include most screens and much of the UX experience, I have not yet brought this project up to production quality. A few items still on the TODO list include:

- Better attention to supporting Accessibility options
- Support for both light and dark modes (currently only dark)
- Refinement of transitions and animations throughout the app
- Added UI Testing
- Additional Unit Testing where it makes sense (business logic is minimal)
- Revisiting and replacing placeholder imagery
